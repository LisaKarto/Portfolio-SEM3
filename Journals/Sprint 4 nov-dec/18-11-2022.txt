23:12: You are reading my first sprint Journal

I decided to keep this journals after the intensive slacking I've done for the past 2 months.
I think it perhaps might help to track my thoughts and working hours... However I've started journaling too late today haha. So excuse this very sloppy entry

What I've done today:

- Set up github environment to work in during my individual project

- Set up Portfolio

- Created first Journal

- Moved repositories to right github account

Today's reflection:

It had been a while since I'd worked on my individual project, I'd started to worry..
So making progress today felt good, I tried to not be too sloppy with my work. I find I quite enjoyed today.
Looking forward to doing work tomorrow. I prefer working over the weekends.
I consider today rather succesful, did a lot of thinking and have a good idea in which direction I want to shape my portfolio.
Although many plans are still up for discussion.

What I want to get done for tomorrow:

- Set up planning for my individual project
	- Establish consistent work hours [nothing too detailed]
- Think about how to work each user story.. (requires a lot of research)
- Think about what topics to use for my research report. To discuss with teacher 
- Figure out what needs to be done to achieve each learning outcome
- Write down the planning for group project
	- Plan out a day to work on group project researches
		- Stakeholders
		- Business Processes
		- Ethics
		- Cultural

I don't think I will achieve all of it, I am likely to scrap a few things.
However if I'll be rather satisfied if I manage just a few to get done. 
Progress is progress. 

A goal without a plan is just a wish.

That's the end to my journal and work day.
