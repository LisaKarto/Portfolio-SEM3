# Introduction

During semester 3 of the Fontys HBO-ICT demand based programme, Fontys challenges it's students to complete 2 courses. Namely an individual course and a group project course. This document is written with focus on my group project course experience. If you want to read more about my experience and what I've been doing for the individual course you can find more information in the central portfolio document [here](https://github.com/LisaKarto/Portfolio-SEM3).  

The group project course enforces you to work alongside multiple other developers on a project at once for a partner in education, which helps you build your coding skills as well as your social skills all while giving you a sense of the "real world". In this document you'll find the information on topics such as, who the stakeholders for the project are, Our workflow during the project, what the project is and how it improves the current business process, what ethical decisions we've had to make and much more. You will also be able to find all of our work in this document.

# Stakeholders
 
## **Professors**

## **Our team, Parkkings**

At the start of the course the class gets tasked to construct teams of about 7 members to work with for the following 4 months. And naturally everyone settles with whoever they've coincidently have been sitting at the same table with. And so the team Parkkings was made. I've worked with these people for several months and it's safe to say that I haven't the faintest idea of who they really are. 

### **Who are we**

Our team Parkkings consists out of Fontys HBO-ICT students that follow the demand based programme. We all share the same profile, software engineering. 

### **Our goal**
We hope to build a functional product to satisfy our product owners, teachers and pass the semester whilst learning new skills and building upon our already existing skills.

### **Members and roles**
To form a team you need members and each member usually holds some sort of role. Below are listed the members of Parkkings as well as some information on our the roles, we've had during this semester.

#### **Members:**
* Atalay, GÃ¶kay - student, software engineering
* Derks, Jaimy  - student, software engineering - (Start semester - December)
* Eijnde, Davey, van den - student, software engineering
* Kartodimedjo, Lisa - student, software engineering
* Meegdes, Lean - student, software engineering
* Peeters, Ramon - student, software engineering
* Walraven, Jordy - student, software engineering

#### **Roles**
We decided not to hold any static roles so everyone can get in touch with a little bit of everything at once. So roles switched during each sprint. So at the end we've all had some experience in various scrum roles as well as coding experiences in each field. Below I've listed the roles we've all shared.

**Technical roles:**
* Working on the back-end of the software product
* Working on the front-end of the software product
* Flexing between/assisting

**Scrum roles:**
* Scrum master
* Team member
