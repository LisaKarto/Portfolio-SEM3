# Introduction

During semester 3 of the Fontys HBO-ICT demand based programme, Fontys challenges it's students to complete 2 courses. Namely an individual course and a group project course. This document is written with focus on my group project course experience. If you want to read more about my experience and what I've been doing for the individual course you can find more information in the central portfolio document [here](https://github.com/LisaKarto/Portfolio-SEM3).  

The group project course enforces you to work alongside multiple other developers on a project at once for a partner in education, which helps you build your coding skills as well as your social skills all while giving you a sense of the "real world". In this document you'll find the information on topics such as, who the stakeholders for the project are, Our workflow during the project, what the project is and how it improves the current business process, what ethical decisions we've had to make and much more. You will also be able to find all of our work in this document.

# Stakeholders
 
## **Professors**
During the semesters you have designated professors that will grade your work, 
Some are more involved with the individual course and others are more involved with the group course. Here are listed the professors I've had related to the group project course and what roles they haad during this course.

**Name**: Thijs Naus  
**Role**: Group project course tutor  
**Actions**: Giving feedback, available for support/advice, grading overall process, observing over all process, lectures when necessary, pep talks

**Name**: John Wijnen   
**Role**: Semester coach  
**Actions**: Leading retrospectives, available for support/advice, giving feedback, grading overall process

## **Our team, Parkkings**

At the start of the course the class gets tasked to construct teams of about 7 members to work with for the following 4 months. And naturally everyone settles with whoever they've coincidently have been sitting at the same table with. And so the team Parkkings was made. I've worked with these people for several months and it's safe to say that I haven't the faintest idea of who they really are. 

### **Who are we**

Our team Parkkings consists out of Fontys HBO-ICT students that follow the demand based programme. We all share the same profile, software engineering. 

### **Our goal**
We hope to build a functional product to satisfy our product owners, teachers and pass the semester whilst learning new skills and building upon our already existing skills.

### **Members and roles**
To form a team you need members and each member usually holds some sort of role. Below are listed the members of Parkkings as well as some information on our the roles, we've had during this semester.

#### **Members:**
* Atalay, GÃ¶kay - student, software engineering
* Derks, Jaimy  - student, software engineering - (Start semester - December)
* Eijnde, Davey, van den - student, software engineering
* Kartodimedjo, Lisa - student, software engineering
* Meegdes, Lean - student, software engineering
* Peeters, Ramon - student, software engineering
* Walraven, Jordy - student, software engineering

#### **Roles**
We decided not to hold any static roles so everyone can get in touch with a little bit of everything at once. So roles switched during each sprint. So at the end we've all had some experience in various scrum roles as well as coding experiences in each field. Below I've listed the roles we've all shared.

**Technical roles:**
* Working on the back-end of the software product
* Working on the front-end of the software product
* Flexing between/assisting

**Scrum roles:**
* Scrum master
* Team member

# The project

Mediaan has had for parking garages but don't currently have the resources to build a proof of concept for. And that's where we, Parkkings come in to play. 


<!-- Requirements -->
## **The parking garage case**
<!-- Is this allowed to be public? -->
**Milestone 1, MVP(Minimal viable product):**  
When a driver arrives at the gate of a garage, he/she can open the gate by identifying themselves and the system will register their license plate. They will park their car and can do whatever they need to do. When they want to drive out of the garage, they can pay for their ticket the gate will then open for the. People can also reserve a parking spot in the garage up-front, making sure a spot is free for them around the time they want to arrive.

The amount of people need to pay depends on the length of their stay and the time of day. Parking staff can define specific tariffs for certain moments in the day or for certain days in a week. On their overview, they can see the daily revenue in real-time.

**Milestone 2:**  
The staff at the garage have a real-time overview of the state of the garage. They can see which lots are vacant occupied or reserved. Whenever they see something in the garage that blocks a parking spot, they have the option to disable this lot in the system. For example, it might be that someone parked a car across multiple spots or some construction is going on.

**Milestone 3:**  
All of the parking garages owned by the company lie in places where many businesses reside. Some of these businesses have a lack of parking space on their own grounds and want to hire some parking spots in the garage. Employees of such companies can park their company car for free on the hired spots during work hours. The parking staff can fine non-employees for parking on these spots. Outside of work hours, hired spots can be used  by anyone. Every month, the system sends all companies an invoice.

**Bonus:**  
Many parking garages have multple exists which lead to different areas of the city above. People always want to park their car as close as possible to their wanted destination. The company has decided to invest in projectors that can project arrows on the ground that drivers can see. By stating their destination (by reserving up-front or indicating it at the gate), the system will lead them to a free parking spot that is closest to the exit for their destination.

From that information we have set up a bunch of user stories based on each milestone, which you can find in our [Jira environment's backlog](https://s3-gp-groep2.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/PAR/boards/1/backlog). The use stories are marked their milestone.

# Technicalities
Software consists out of a bunch of building blocks, building blocks like languages and frameworks and a lot more that's going on below that. But the way we software developers create it is by utilizing languages and frameworks. Now decisions need to be made, which languages and frameworks do you use for what project and why? In this chapter I will list what we have made use of during our building process and why. You will also find diagrams to help clearify these architectural structures.

For this semester Fontys has challenged it's software engineering students to set up a distributed architecture since this has many benefits and is commonly used in software development today. So we better get to learning. This is the reason that we've chosen to set up REST api's for the backend. Fontys also wanted us to use a javascript based framework for the front end and that pairs well with a REST api distributed architecture. 

## Architecture and infrastructure

### Languages and frameworks used:
Underneath I have listed the languages alongsides the frameworks we have decided to use for the project.

**Backend:** 
* **Main REST API:** C# - ASP.NET
* **CMS REST API:** C# - ASP.NET
* **DATABASE:** SQL server

**Frontend:**
* **MAIN UI:** Javascript, HTML, CSS - REACT
* **CMS UI:** Javascript, HTML, CSS - REACT

**External services:**
* Google Oauth 2.0
