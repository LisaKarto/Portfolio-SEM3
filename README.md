# <a id="Introduction"></a>1. Introduction

Over the period of September the 8th 2022 until January the 26th 2023 I have been following the HBO ICT Demand based software engineering course at Fontys university of applied sciences. To establish what I've learnt I've put together this portfolio. Having established this portfolio helps to demonstrate how far I've come to prove sufficient at the necessary learning outcomes of this semester. Within this portfolio you will be able to find all the information for all the different products on which I've worked this semester.

My portfolio consists out of several parts. This document serves as the central part, which is why it consists out of a introduction, reader's guide, afterword and not much more. More information about my portfolio's structure and contents can be found underneath the next topic [Reader's guide.](#Readers_guide)

In case of any questions about my portfolio, I have left my [contact info](#contact_info) at the top of this document. I won't remember much as I am not God. But feel free to try and ask me about stuff anyway.

<!-- How to read this portfolio? -->
## <a id="Portfolio_structure"></a> 2.1 Portfolio structure

I've split this portfolio into multiple parts in order to avoid my portfolio becoming one very tall brain numbing document, instead this way it's set up that the reader can specifically choose the type of topics to numb their brain with.

I've set up the structure in a way that you can read through it and access all locations as one cohorent story. However as there is a lot of content it would be tedious to go through the whole thing when looking for a specific topic. Therefore for the sake of practicality and not overwhelming my reader's feeble brain for my reader is me. I decided to structure the portfolio to have a simple central point of navigation that can lead everywhere thus this document. This way I also aim to keep certain matters seperated for a clearer overview and again practical use.

Thank you for helping me realise that I am flawed.  
###### knowing that no one will read this portfolio brings me comfort.
