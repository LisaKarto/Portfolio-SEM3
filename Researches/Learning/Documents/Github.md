# Learning GitHub

Although I am fairly familiar with Git and GitHub for version control and quick code publishing solely. 
I havn't got that much *proper* github experience, which is what prompted me to learn and document it now. Meaning I haven't used much of Git's branching and merging features and have never before really explored GitHub's project boards, code reviewing, branch protections features etc. So I figured, the time is now. 

<!-- In this document I will be following Github's own "Introduction to GitHub" course from GitHub SKills. Sources are listed in the bottom of this document. -->


# Version control systems

### **Version control and version control software**
Version control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to computer programs, documents and could also be applied to other software or digital files.
However doing this manually has a lot of flaws as well as it is time consuming and honestly.. tedious. But since it's a very essential practice, used in almost every development process from individual passion projects to large projects made in teams. So naturally the smart brains that roam around this planet have invented something that assists you in this process. Namely, Version control systems. 


### **popular version control systems**
Below I have included a pie chart that shows data on the top 5 version control systems.

**figure 1:** popular version control system chart.

### **What is CVS**

### **What is Perforce**

### **What is Mercurial**

### **What is SVN**

Git is a version control management system that allows you to keep track of your source code history. Utilizing Git's features can make your project's development a lot more efficient, especially when developing in large groups. Git is mainly popular for it's efficiency and simplicity. 

### **Why I chose Git**

I chose git because as you can see on figure 1 above, it's popularity far outruns the other systems and since I am a beginner on version control I figure I should opt with the option that holds the largest community. Why? because when it has a large community that often means that it has a lot of support, meaning there will always be people who can help me with issues and likely there will be more documentation on it than the other options.

# Source code hosting platforms

## What is GitHub
Now you know Git and it's own fundamentals, we can visit "GitHub" and what it is. Because these 2 go hand in hand.
