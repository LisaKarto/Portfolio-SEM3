# Introduction

In this document you will find the results I've reached during a research I've carried out to answer the following question; "How can I implement version control to my project?". 


To reach the answer to this main question I will answer the following sub questions: 

- How can I implement good version control in my project?
  - What is version control?
  - Why do I need version control?
  - What are version control tools?
    - What version control tools are available?
    - Which one of these version control tools best fit my project?
  - What are version control platforms? 
    - What version control platforms are available?
    - Which one of these version control platforms best fit my project?


At the end of this document I have written a conclusion where I revisit the questions once again and provide my final answer to the main question; "How can I implement version control to my project?".

This research has been carried out with the Design oriented Triangulation(DOT) framework in mind. For those interested I have written what DOT framework methods I've used during this research.

# How can I implement version control in my project?
In the following section I will answer a few sub questions that will lead towards the answer to the main question. It's important to adress these sub questions as they lay the base to the main question.

## What is version control?
Version control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to computer programs, documents and could also be applied to other software or digital files.

### Why do I need version control?
Version control software keeps track of every modification 

And no work is lost

Helps centrilize your work

With additional tooling it can help you publish your source code to other developers

When implementing a good workflow team cooperation is accelerated and safer

Specifically version control proves to be useful for multiple purposes, for example: 
You're working with a group of developers on a 
You want to share your work
You want to revert back to an older version of your code

## Version control systems
Managing version control manually has a lot of flaws as well as it is time consuming and honestly.. tedious. But it's a very essential practice, used in almost every development process from individual passion projects to large projects made in teams. So naturally the smart brains that roam around this planet have invented something that assists you in this process. Namely, Version control systems. 


**What type of version control system best suits my project?** 
Firstly there's 2 distinctive types of version control systems, namely a centralized version control system and a Decenentralized version control system.

**Centralized version control systems**

**Decentralized version control systems**


**What version control systems are available?**
Because my 
I am aiming at decentralized version control systems
Today's most popular version control systems are the following:

**Which one of these version control systems best fit my project?**

Out of these 3 version control systems, I conclude that Git is the best suited for my project and it's requirements because; Git has a large community surrounding it and is very popular, because of that a lot of other tools are familiar with Git
And most developers will know Git, making outsourcing and cooperation easier as there's a bigger chance that theyre familiar with it's working.
Beginner friendliness. Optimized Guis
Fast and efficient
Supports most uses, With Git I will be able to achieve what I need to.




# Conclusion

**So how can I implement version control in my project?**
Like written in my [project description]() at the start of this report.
It's a project that should be suitable for expansion worked on by a small development team that has the possibility to increase in the future.
The project is prone to being outsourced
The project has to be accesible by third party developers

Because of those needs using a decentrilized version control tool is fatal as people should be able to work on the source code at every moment with minimal chance failure.

The project's architecture is distributed meaning the application is split into multiple projects, therefore multiple repositories need to be made.
