# Version Control substansiation report

# Introduction

In this document you can find information on a quick research I've done on version control. With this document I hope to clarify the choice for version control tools that I am using. 

# My background

Although I am fairly familiar with Git and GitHub for version control and quick code publishing solely. I haven't got that much *proper* version control experience. I've done the tedious manual nooby version control and then quickly got hooked to using Git's basic functions. But I have never really done any research on whatever else is out there. So I want to explore and document that now. 

I am familiar with the top leading source code hosting platforms however, namely GitHub and GitLab.

# Version control systems

### **Version control and version control software**
Version control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to computer programs, documents and could also be applied to other software or digital files.
However doing this manually has a lot of flaws as well as it is time consuming and honestly.. tedious. But since it's a very essential practice, used in almost every development process from individual passion projects to large projects made in teams. So naturally the smart brains that roam around this planet have invented something that assists you in this process. Namely, Version control systems. 

### **Comparing version control software**
Underneath I have listed a couple of version control software that are out there free to use. You can read the core of the software as well as some pros and cons. In the end I am giving a conclusion which states which version control software I have chosen for my current project and why.

### **What is CVS**

### **What is Perforce**

### **What is Mercurial**

### **What is SVN**

### **What is Git**
Git is a version control management system that allows you to keep track of your source code history. Utilizing Git's features can make your project's development a lot more efficient, especially when developing in large groups. Git is mainly popular for it's efficiency and simplicity. 

### **Why I chose Git**



# Source code hosting platforms

## What is GitHub
Now you know Git and it's own fundamentals, we can visit "GitHub" and what it is. Because these 2 go hand in hand.

### Alternatives

## Git bash
## GitHub desktop
